# GEDI-Data-Resources


Welcome! This repository provides guides, short how-tos, and tutorials to help users access and work with data from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) mission. In the interest of open science this repository has been made public but is still under active development. All jupyter notebooks and scripts should be functional, however, changes or additions may be made. Contributions from all parties are welcome.
